# Emerging Technologies Tasks

Y4S1 Emerging Technologies Tasks Assessment

## Running

You can run the notebook by first installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and then executing the below command from within the repository's root directory.

```sh
$ jupyter notebook
```

## Tasks

### 1. Square Root of 2

Write a Python function called `sqrt2` that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. Your code should not depend on any module from the standard library or otherwise. You should research the task first and include references and a description of your algorithm.

### 2. Chi-squared Test for Independence

The Chi-squared test for independence is a statistical hypothesis test like a *t*-test. It is used to analyse whether two categorical variables are independent. The [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chi-squared_test&oldid=983024096) article gives the table below as an example, stating the Chi-squared value based on it is approximately 24.6. Use `scipy.stats` to verify this value and calculate the associated *p* value. You should include a short note with references justifying your analysis in a markdown cell.
