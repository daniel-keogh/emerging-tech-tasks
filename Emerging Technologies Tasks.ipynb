    "Floating point numbers are used to represent fractional values and are stored in a computer as base 2 (binary) fractions. Most decimal fractions cannot be accurately represented as binary fractions and as a result, decimal floating-point numbers are only approximated by the binary floating-point numbers actually stored in the machine [1]. For instance, the summation of $0.1$ and $0.2$ yields a result of $0.3$ in decimal. However, the result of this computation cannot be accurately represented in binary (see below)."

    "The IEEE standard defines 32-bit and 64-bit floating-point representations. The 32-bit (single-precision) format consists of a sign bit, an 8-bit exponent and 23 bits of mantissa. The 64-bit (double-precision) format consists of a sign bit, an 11-bit exponent and 52 bits of mantissa. Floating-point arithmetic on computers is therefore inherently inexact as the 24 bits of mantissa in a 32-bit floating-point number can only represent approximately 7 significant decimal digits (for doubles this is 15-17 decimal digits [3]). If a number is not exactly representable, then it must instead be approximated [2].\n",

    "Python's float type has double-precision [1], and it is therefore not possible to store a number with 100 decimal places as a float. However, in Python integers have unlimited precision [4], so one approach to the given problem is to store all the significant digits of $\\sqrt2$ as an integer. Finding the square root of a given number $p$, as an integer can be achieved by calculating the *integer square root* of $p*10^{2 * q}$, where $q$ is the number of digits after the decimal point, in this case 100."

Newton's algorithm works by producing successively better approximations of the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function [6]. It starts with some guess $z$, and then adjusts $z$ based on how close $z^{2}$ is to $x$, producing a better guess [7]. The process is continuously repeated until a sufficiently accurate value is reached."
