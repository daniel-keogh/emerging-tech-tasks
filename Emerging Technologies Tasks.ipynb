    "The IEEE standard defines 32-bit and 64-bit floating-point representations. The 32-bit (single-precision) format consists of a sign bit, an 8-bit exponent and 23 bits of mantissa. The 64-bit (double-precision) format consists of a sign bit, an 11-bit exponent and 52 bits of mantissa. Floating-point arithmetic on computers is therefore inherently inexact as the 24 bits of mantissa in a 32-bit floating-point number can only represent approximately 7 significant decimal digits (for doubles this is about 16 significant decimal digits \\[2\\]\\[3\\]).

In its simplest form, the function takes an `array_like` object containing the observed frequencies in each category. In the code above, we express the values in the table as a two dimensional NumPy array and pass that into the `chi2_contingency` function. The function returns a 4-tuple [8], however for the purposes of this task we are only interested in the first two values, the test statistic and the *p* value.\n",

It is expressed by the below formula, where $O$ is the observed value and $E$ is the expected value [9]. Applying this formula over all of the cells in our table and then summing the result calculates the test statistic [9], which is the value ultimately returned by the `chi2_contingency` function. \n",
