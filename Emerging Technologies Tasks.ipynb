The formula used to calculate the SD of a dataset differs depending on whether the data is being considered a population of its own, or as a *sample* of a larger population [10]. A dataset is termed a population if it contains all the members of a specified group (i.e. if it contains the entire list of possible data values) [11]. A sample on the other hand, contains only a subset of a population and the size of a sample is always less than the size of the population from which it was taken [11].\n",

Bessel's correction is an adjustment made to correct for the bias that occurs when working with sample data and is used to provide a better estimation of the standard deviation of a population [12]. When performing standard deviation calculations, Bessel's correction is applied by subtracting 1 from the sample size (i.e. it's applied by dividing by `len(x) - 1` instead of `len(x)`) [12].\n",

Because of this distinction, the `STDEV.S` function is better suited for estimating the standard deviation of a dataset when provided with only a sample of a larger population. This is illustrated in the below example."

The algorithm then performs iterative calculations in order to best optimize the positions of the centroids [13]."
