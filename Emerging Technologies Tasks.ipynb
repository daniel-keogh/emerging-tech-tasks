Most decimal fractions cannot be accurately represented as binary fractions and as a result, decimal floating-point numbers are only approximated by the binary floating-point numbers actually stored in the machine \\[1\\]. For instance, the summation of $0.1$ and $0.2$ yields a result of $0.3$ in decimal. However, the result of this computation cannot be accurately represented in binary (see below)."

The 64-bit (double-precision) format consists of a sign bit, an 11-bit exponent and 52 bits of mantissa. Floating-point arithmetic on computers is therefore inherently inexact as the 24 bits of mantissa in a 32-bit floating-point number can only represent approximately 7 significant decimal digits (for doubles this is about 16 significant decimal digits \\[2\\]\\[3\\]). If a number is not exactly representable, then it must instead be approximated \\[2\\].\n",

The formula used to calculate the SD of a dataset differs depending on whether the data is being considered a population of its own, or as a *sample* of a larger population [10]. A dataset is termed a population if it contains all the members of a specified group (i.e. if it contains the entire list of possible data values) [11]. A sample on the other hand, contains only a subset of a population and the size of a sample is always less than the size of the population from which it was taken [11].\n",

Bessel's correction is an adjustment made to correct for the bias that occurs when working with sample data and is used to provide a better estimation of the standard deviation of a population [12]. When performing standard deviation calculations, Bessel's correction is applied by subtracting 1 from the sample size (i.e. it's applied by dividing by `len(x) - 1` instead of `len(x)`) [12].\n",

Because of this distinction, the `STDEV.S` function is better suited for estimating the standard deviation of a dataset when provided with only a sample of a larger population. This is illustrated in the below example."

    "The objective of k-means clustering is to group together similar data points and discover underlying patterns by looking for a fixed number ($k$) of clusters in a dataset [13]. The k-means algorithm identifies $k$ number of centroids, and then allocates each data point to the nearest cluster, while keeping the centroids as small as possible [13].\n",

    "A *cluster* refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities [13], while a *centroid* is the mean position of the points assigned to a cluster [14].\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the k-means algorithm is provided with the number of clusters ($k$) that should be used to partition the data. It then randomly selects $k$ points from the dataset to use as the initial centroids. Each point in the dataset is assigned a cluster based on its nearest centroid [14]. The algorithm then performs iterative calculations in order to best optimize the positions of the centroids [13].\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accuracy\n",
    "Because the initial centroids are chosen randomly, k-means will likely give different results each time it is run [14]. Furthermore, the clusters are assumed to be spherical and evenly sized, something which may reduce the accuracy of k-means clustering results [13]."
